# forge
hypixel skyblock android app to notify when forge ended

built in react native javascript expo

only notifies when you have opened it atleast once before the forge has ended

if you think its virus just build yourself smh, also I dont even know how to make virus lol

combine with a phone minecraft launcher for best results

(i recommend PojavLauncher https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher#getting-pojavlauncher)

# config
get api key from hypixel(/api new)

supports all forge items and their durations

most dead discord server ever: https://discord.gg/ssEuNYkzpe


# how to build yourself
make new expo project

```npx create-expo-app forge```

install dependancies(some stuff are already installed)

```npm install <each thing in packages.json>``` one by one

download the repo and paste it over the files previously made


build using 

```eas build --profile production --platform android```

you will need eas profile to do that which takes very little time to set up
